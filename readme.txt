Protect your dignity! Prevent the Internet Archive Wayback Machine from saving periodic snapshots of your website.

== Description ==

Block Internet Archive is a simple plugin that will prevent the Internet Archive Wayback Machine from saving periodic snapshots of your website.

The best time to install this plugin is as soon as your site goes live, before the Wayback Machine has a chance to crawl it.

If the Wayback Machine has already saved snapshots of your site, installing this plugin will prevent the public from accessing the existing snapshots and prevent the Wayback Machine from creating any more.

However, if you ever deactivate the plugin, all previously existing snapshots will again become accessible to the public and the Wayback Machine may create new ones.
